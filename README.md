so uhhh I'm not an experienced programmer or anything which is why I have no idea what to put here

okay rules: basically you start with a random 4-lettered word (e.g. "read") which you have to rewrite to another random 4-lettered word (e.g. "face") by changing one letter at a time. Basically, "read" -> "reed" and so on
